## Breast Cancer DGE Analysis

🧬 Project Overview

This project focuses on the differential gene expression (DGE) analysis to identify cytotoxicity-related genes involved in the progression of breast cancer. Five key genes—BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, ALK, and MYCN—were identified from RNA sequencing data of breast tumor and normal tissues.
